Cache API: `caches.default` / `caches.open(name)` (baronunread/sproutboat#59), with `match()`/`put()`/`delete()` backed by both transports (broker's `cache.*` ops and the standalone embedded transport, so behavior matches whichever way the app deploys). Keyed on method+URL for v1 (no `Vary` support yet). `put()` throws for a non-GET request, matching the spec; a 206 status or an explicit `no-store`/`private` `Cache-Control` is a silent no-op rather than an error, matching Workers' own `caches.default`. TTL derives from `s-maxage` (preferred) or `max-age`; entries with neither have no expiry.

Deliberately synchronous, not Promise-returning: every other buffered-body method this runtime already ships (`text()`/`json()`/`arrayBuffer()`/`blob()`/`formData()`) is sync too, and this runtime's own coroutine machinery has a known, still-open memory-corruption issue tied specifically to nested `async function` calls accumulating across many requests (baronunread/sproutboat#168) — no reason to add more async surface here. `await caches.default.match(...)` still reads correctly: awaiting a non-promise value resolves to it immediately.
