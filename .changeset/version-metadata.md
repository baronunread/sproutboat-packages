Version metadata binding (baronunread/sproutboat#126). `sproutboat.jsonc` gains a `version_metadata` key naming a binding (like wrangler's `[version_metadata]`), and `wrapNativeFetchHandler` bakes `env.<binding> = { id, tag, timestamp }` directly into the module at build time — no broker round trip. `id`/`tag`/`timestamp` are supplied by the caller (the CLI derives them from the artifact digest, the project name, and the build time); this package only wires the config field through and does the baking.
