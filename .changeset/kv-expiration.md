KV: native key expiration (baronunread/sproutboat#58). `env.KV.put(key, value, { expirationTtl })` / `{ expiration }` now match the Cloudflare Workers contract: `expirationTtl` is seconds from now (rejected below 60, matching CF), `expiration` is an absolute unix-seconds timestamp. An expired key reads as absent from `get()` and is omitted from `list()`; the row is hard-deleted lazily the next time it's touched by a get. No new transport op — both `expirationTtl` and `expiration` are optional fields on the existing `kv.put` frame, so an older broker/prelude pair that ignores them keeps working exactly as before.
