Shared-object (split) builds no longer crash on start or lose the Web Streams classes.

- **Toolchain:** split output prefixes module globals with `pg_`. A global named like a libc symbol (the prelude's `clone`, or an app's `hash` or `search`) bound to libc instead, so the runtime wrote into libc's code and every worker crashed. Internal `__` globals keep their names. Standalone builds are unchanged, because their globals are `static`.
- **Runtime:** the Web Streams polyfill installs each class with its own `globalThis.X =` assignment. Where the prelude is a separate unit, Porffor resolved `new ReadableStream()` in app code at compile time and, seeing only a dynamic install, compiled it to a ReferenceError. `gen-streams.ts` now fails if an export of the polyfill is not installed.
