Fix async handlers failing permanently with `TypeError: Cannot get property of null` after a few requests (baronunread/sproutboat#168). Porffor represents `null` as an object-typed value with pointer 0, so a promise resolving to `null` went through the `then` probe and looked `then` up at memory offset 0. Once `Date.prototype.toISOString` had written there, the probe matched, read `null.then` and rejected, and every later async function returning `null` failed the same way. A patch to `compiler/builtins/promise.ts` keeps `null` out of the probe.
