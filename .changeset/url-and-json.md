`URL` behaves like the WHATWG URL: `new URL(path, base)`, setters for every part (`url.hostname = ...`, `port`, `protocol`, `host`, `search`, `hash`, `href`), default ports dropped, dot segments resolved, percent-encoding, `URL.canParse`, and `searchParams` changes written back into the URL. `JSON.stringify` calls `toJSON`, so a `Date` serializes as its ISO string (it was `{}`) and a `URL` as its href.
