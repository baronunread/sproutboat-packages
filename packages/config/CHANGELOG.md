# @sproutboat/config

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 4dd16b7: `fetch()` reaches any public address and never a private or reserved one (baronunread/sproutboat#174). The `outbound` allowlist is gone.
  
  - Both backends, the broker and the standalone client, check the address they resolved, not the hostname, so DNS rebinding can't get past the check. The broker connects to the vetted address and verifies TLS against the name.
  - Blocked: loopback, RFC 1918, link-local and cloud metadata, CGNAT, benchmarking, documentation, multicast and reserved ranges, IPv6 ULA and link-local, and the IPv4 address inside IPv4-mapped, NAT64 and 6to4 addresses.
  - An operator can let addresses through with `SB_EGRESS_ALLOW` (`*` or exact addresses) in the broker's or the binary's environment. Handler code can't.
  - `@sproutboat/runtime`: `URL.hostname` and `URL.port` handle IPv6 literals (`[::1]:9` used to give hostname `[`). Every sprout gets `fetch()`, with no binding needed. `validateHttpSyncSource` no longer takes an `outboundAllowed` argument, and `Bindings` loses `outbound`.
  - `@sproutboat/wire`: `Bindings` loses `outbound`.
  - `@sproutboat/config`: `outbound` is accepted but ignored, with a warning in the new `warnings` field of a successful parse (`OUTBOUND_IGNORED`). It will be refused in a later minor release.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 7287d9b: Version metadata binding (baronunread/sproutboat#126). `sproutboat.jsonc` gains a `version_metadata` key naming a binding (like wrangler's `[version_metadata]`), and `wrapNativeFetchHandler` bakes `env.<binding> = { id, tag, timestamp }` directly into the module at build time — no broker round trip. `id`/`tag`/`timestamp` are supplied by the caller (the CLI derives them from the artifact digest, the project name, and the build time); this package only wires the config field through and does the baking.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Rate Limiting binding (baronunread/sproutboat#69): `env.<NAME>.limit({ key }) ->
  { success }`.
  
  - Config: `ratelimiters: [{ binding, limit, period }]` in `sproutboat.jsonc` —
    at most `limit` calls per `period` seconds, per key.
  - A fixed-window counter (`ratelimit` table) on **both** transports: the
    embedded one for standalone binaries, and the broker (`ratelimit.check` op,
    in the replay-dedup set) for deployed sprouts. `limit` / `period` travel in
    the message so the op stays stateless.
  - `ponytail`: fixed window, so a burst across the boundary can briefly reach
    ~2x; swap for a two-window weighted count if that matters.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6e131e6: Adopt config parsing and artifact manifest from sproutboat-cli (moved verbatim, frozen behavior). First publishable versions; consumed via `file:` links until the npm publish flow lands.
