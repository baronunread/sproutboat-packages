# @sproutboat/toolchain

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- afd054c: Fix (baronunread/sproutboat#172): a standalone/native-fetch response body,
  header name, or header value whose code points all fit one byte (any Latin-1-
  range string — most non-astral JS strings) reached the wire as raw Latin-1
  bytes instead of UTF-8, corrupting any non-ASCII text regardless of the
  declared `charset`. `patchRenderJs` now encodes Porffor's `bytestring`
  representation the same way its `string` (UTF-16) branch already did. Plain
  ASCII output is unaffected (identical in both encodings).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- New package: `@sproutboat/toolchain` — the single home for the Porffor pin
  (`pin.ts`), the source patches (`patch.ts`: `ensurePorfforPatched` plus the
  `$PORT`, request-body-limit, status-line, console-sink and remote-address
  passes), and `ensurePorffor()` (fetch, verify sha256, extract, patch, cache in
  `~/.cache/sproutboat`).
  
  `sproutboat-cli` and the `sproutboat` monorepo both depend on it instead of
  carrying their own copies, so the pin and the patch set can no longer drift —
  which they had (the monorepo was on `alpha-4` and applied 1 of the ~13 patches).
