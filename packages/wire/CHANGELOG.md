# @sproutboat/wire

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Rate Limiting binding (baronunread/sproutboat#69): `env.<NAME>.limit({ key }) ->
  { success }`.
  
  - Config: `ratelimiters: [{ binding, limit, period }]` in `sproutboat.jsonc` —
    at most `limit` calls per `period` seconds, per key.
  - A fixed-window counter (`ratelimit` table) on **both** transports: the
    embedded one for standalone binaries, and the broker (`ratelimit.check` op,
    in the replay-dedup set) for deployed sprouts. `limit` / `period` travel in
    the message so the op stays stateless.
  - `ponytail`: fixed window, so a burst across the boundary can briefly reach
    ~2x; swap for a two-window weighted count if that matters.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Standalone runtime: client IP, D1 online backup, and a prepared-statement cache.
  
  - `request.cf.clientIp` is populated from the connection's remote address
    (`x-sb-remote-addr`, appended by the server and stripped from client input),
    with `SB_TRUSTED_PROXIES` resolving `X-Forwarded-For` behind a reverse proxy.
    IPv4-mapped IPv6 peers are folded to dotted form. (baronunread/sproutboat#163)
  - `env.<D1>.backup(name?)` — a Sproutboat extension: an online, integrity-checked
    single-file snapshot via `VACUUM INTO`, on both the embedded and broker
    transports. New `d1.backup` op. (baronunread/sproutboat#164)
  - The embedded transport caches prepared statements per database (FIFO, 32/db)
    instead of recompiling the SQL on every binding op. (baronunread/sproutboat#155)

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c45098e: Adopt broker, JSON utilities, assets, wrapper, source validation, both transports and the prelude from sproutboat-cli (moved verbatim). First publishable versions; consumed via `file:` links until the npm publish flow lands.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [c45098e]
  - @sproutboat/assets@0.2.0
